Hi there, I'm Clarissa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer. Most recently, I built Flytrap, an error monitoring tool that centralizes error tracking, provides near real-time notifications, and allows developers to maintain full control over their data and infrastructure. With Flytrap, you can pinpoint bugs faster and streamline debugging across your projects. Check it out below!
