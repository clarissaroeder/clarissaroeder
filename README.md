### Hi there, I'm Clarissa 👋

👩‍💻 I'm a software engineer. 

🌱 Most recently, I built Flytrap, an error monitoring tool that centralises error tracking, provides near real-time notifications, and allows developers to maintain full control over their data and infrastructure. With Flytrap, you can pinpoint bugs faster and streamline debugging across your projects. Check out our [case study](https://getflytrap.github.io/) to learn more!
